" 
In 1888 Dr. B. Hatschek delivered a lecture to the German surgeons in Prague(Praha), which at the time was part of the 
Austro-Hungarian Empire. This was 33 years after the indutrial revolution in central Europe, and 29 years after Darwin's
'On the Origin of Species'. So about this time scientists and the general population were still trying to figure out
how things actually worked. It was evident that sperm+egg = progeney, however the next step in the process of discovery wouldn't 
wouldn't be confirmed for another almost 80 years with the Hershey-Chase experiments with phage DNA. 

Some of the main points:

**assimilation**  and **conjugation** continues life
sexual reproduction, we must recognize, a remedy against the action of injurous variability

...
it may be here that we see where the roots of racial homogeneity and eugenics went awry, when a group of surgeons
took the point the wrong way and just went along with what was obsetensibly just tradition.
...

because afterwards he goes on to explain that the only way for **rectification** of a diseased population is by mingling 
(which is necessary and occurs in sexual reproduction).


And obsensibly, as evidenced 150 years later, this is what actually happens with hybrid vigor of offspring, in that deliterious 
mutations are dampened through genetic crossing of varied parental genetics. 
So obviously Mendel's work in **Verhandlungen des naturforschenden Vereines in Br√ºnn** in 1866, was read and incorporated
by a wider audience that may be realized.
