title: Advantageous misunderstanding: and evolutionary lesson in understanding math, life, and scientific progress

" 
In 1907, A. Einstein submitted and article to the Berlin based journal *Annalen der Physik* entitled *Über die vom Relativitätsprinzip geforderte Trägheit der Energie* or 
*On the inertia of energy required by the relativity principle.* In this he describes the function &mu; = E <sub>0</sub> / V<sup>2</sup>, where %mu; is mass, E is energy,
and V is lichtgeschwindigkeit, or the speed of light. It isn't until the end of the article after describing relativity, and electromanetic energy, and kinetic energy of masses, that he 
is able to demonstrate that all these previous concepts in physical and chemical energetics are interrelated. 

There is a shortcut though. 

If the pure mathematical expression is taken to be homomorphic, that is, consistent and continuous across all variables, including language and disciplines. V stands for not just the speed of light,
but volumes as well.

An this makes sense, in the context
